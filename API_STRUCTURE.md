## REST Principles Applied

### 1. Resource-Based URLs
- Each URL represents a resource
- Use plural nouns for collections
- Use IDs for specific resources

### 2. HTTP Methods
- `GET`: Read data
- `POST`: Create a new resource or perform an action
- `PATCH`: Partial update
- `PUT`: Full update (currently unused)
- `DELETE`: Delete a resource

### 3. Status Codes
- `200 OK`: Successful operation
- `201 Created`: Resource created
- `204 No Content`: Successful deletion
- `400 Bad Request`: Validation error
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required/failed
- `403 Forbidden`: Permission denied
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found

### 4. Nested Resources
Dependent resources are defined as nested paths:
- `/boards/{id}/members/`: Members of a board
- `/boards/{id}/lists/`: Lists of a board
- `/tasks/{id}/comments/`: Comments of a task

### 5. Special Endpoints
- `/me/`: Access current user's resources
- `/public/`: Public resources

## Authentication
All endpoints require authentication except `/auth/register/` and `/auth/login/`.

### Headers
```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

## Response Format
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "field1": "value1",
  "field2": "value2",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Error Format
```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "field_errors": {
    "field_name": ["Error detail"]
  }
}
```

## Pagination
Pagination is used for listing endpoints:
```
GET /api/v1/boards/?page=1&page_size=20
```

## Filtering & Sorting
```
GET /api/v1/tasks/?is_completed=false&priority=high&ordering=-created_at
```

## Notes
- The `/tasks/{id}/toggle-complete/` endpoint exists for better UX â€” a quick way to change completion state
- Completion status can be changed via PATCH (field `is_completed`) or via the toggle endpoint
- User limits are an independent resource, separate from boards
- Invitations are also managed as a top-level resource
